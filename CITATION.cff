abstract: "A reference implementation of a Bicameral Artificial Intelligence architecture that mimics the human Default Mode Network (DMN). It utilizes a dual-process system ('Fast' Thalamus vs. 'Slow' Dreamer) to enable asynchronous memory consolidation and prevent catastrophic forgetting in Long-Term Memory (LTM) systems."
