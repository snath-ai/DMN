# Lár Vision & Philosophy  

## *The Glass Box Era of AI Agents*

Agents today are built on *black boxes*: chains, hidden states, silent failures.

Developers cannot:
- ⁠debug  
- ⁠audit  
- trust  

**`Lár` exists to fix this.**

### Our Core Beliefs  
- ⁠*Agents must be transparent*  
- ⁠*State must be inspectable*  
- ⁠*Execution must be reproducible*  
- ⁠*Errors must be first-class citizens*  
- ⁠*Agents should be engineered, not summoned*  

### We are building the *Glass Box* ecosystem.
- Lár = The open-source engine
