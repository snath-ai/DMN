# Code of Conduct — Lár

We are committed to making the *Lár Engine* community a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background. This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, discussion forums, and community events.

We adopt and enforce the principles of the **Contributor Covenant** as a baseline for our community standards.

## **Our Pledge**  
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, inclusive, diverse, and healthy community. This includes maintaining professionalism, fostering **constructive dialogue**, and prioritizing the **well-being** of our members.

## **Our Standards of Behavior**

The following behaviors are expected and mandatory in all community interactions:

- **Be Kind and Respectful**: Treat others with empathy, kindness, and consideration. Differences in technical opinion are normal, but personal attacks and aggressive behavior are unacceptable.

- **Be Constructive**: Focus feedback on the code and ideas, not on the individual. Provide thoughtful criticism that helps improve the project.

- **Respect Privacy and Boundaries**: Respect confidentiality and do not share private information without explicit permission.

- **Avoid Harassment and Discrimination**: We prohibit all forms of harassment, including offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or technical ability.

## **Reporting and Enforcement**

**A. Reporting Violations**

If you witness or are subject to behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it promptly and confidentially to the project maintainers:

**Email**: [axdithya@snath.ai](mailto:axdithya@snath.ai), [vinay@snath.ai](mailto:vinay@snath.ai)

**Reporting**: Include the necessary context, names of individuals involved, and any evidence (screenshots, links) to help the maintainers investigate the situation efficiently.

**B. Enforcement**

All reports will be reviewed, investigated, and handled discreetly and fairly. Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take swift and appropriate corrective action in response to any violations.

Consequences for violations may include:

- **Warning**: A private written warning.

- **Temporary Ban**: A temporary exclusion from project spaces.

- **Permanent Ban**: Permanent removal from all project spaces in cases of persistent misconduct.
