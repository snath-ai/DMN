# Security Policy

This policy outlines the supported versions of Lár Engine and the formal procedure for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

Security patches and bug fixes are applied to the `latest minor release` of the Lár Engine framework.

| Status      | Version Format                               | Security Support                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Supported   | Latest Minor Release (e.g., 0.7.x)            | Full patches and critical bug fixes are provided.         |
| Unsupported | Previous Minor Releases (e.g., 0.6.x and older) | No new security patches will be issued. Users should upgrade immediately. |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the *Lár Engine* framework and its users seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, we ask that you follow the process of **responsible disclosure**.

- **Reporting Channel**: Please report vulnerabilities exclusively via email to: [**axdithya@snath.ai**](mailto:axdithya@snath.ai), [**vinay@snath.ai**](mailto:vinay@snath.ai)
- **Response Time**: We commit to acknowledging receipt of your email within 24 hours and providing an initial assessment of the vulnerability within 48 hours.
- **Public Disclosure**: **Do not open public GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, or discuss vulnerabilities on public forums (e.g., social media or Discord)**. Public disclosure before a fix is released endangers all users.

## Disclosure and Remediation

- We will work with the reporter to confirm the vulnerability and develop a fix.

- Once a fix is available, we will release a security patch and publicly disclose the vulnerability, crediting the reporter (if they wish to be named).
