## Power Your IDE (Cursor / Windsurf)

Lár is optimized for AI-assisted coding. The repository includes two files to make your IDE an expert "Lár Architect."

### The 2-Step Workflow

1.  **Reference The Rules**: In your chat, type `@lar/IDE_MASTER_PROMPT.md`. This is the "brain" that contains the strict typing rules and graph philosophy.
2.  **Use The Template**: Fill out `@lar/IDE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` with your agent's requirements.

**Why?**
Referencing the file ensures the AI uses the latest, official coding standards without you needing to copy-paste giant prompts.
